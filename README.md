# Samatrix Data Analysis Summer Internship

This repository showcases seven comprehensive data analysis projects
carried out during an internship at **Samatrix.io**, focusing on
applying statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world
problems.

Each project follows a systematic workflow --- from **data acquisition
and preprocessing** to **analysis, visualization, and interpretation**
--- providing hands-on experience in diverse domains such as **finance,
marketing, operations, healthcare, manufacturing, sports, and
politics**.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Portfolio Risk Assessment (VaR)

-   **Domain**: Finance Risk Management
-   **Goal**: Estimate the **1-Day 95% Value at Risk** for a portfolio
    of four stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN).
-   **Techniques**: Log returns, parametric normal/t-distribution,
    historical simulation, hypothesis testing.
-   **Outcome**: Reliable portfolio risk estimates with diversification
    insights and backtesting validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2️⃣ A/B Testing

-   **Domain**: Marketing  Business Analytics
-   **Goal**: Compare conversion rates between two variants (A & B) to
    test for statistically significant improvements.
-   **Techniques**: Data simulation, Z-proportion test, confidence
    intervals, sequential monitoring.
-   **Outcome**: Variant B significantly outperformed Variant A with a
    **2.33% lift** in conversion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3️⃣ Call Center Operations Optimization

-   **Domain**: Operations Research Customer Service
-   **Goal**: Simulate and optimize staffing levels in a call center
    environment to minimize customer wait times.
-   **Techniques**: Queuing theory (Poisson arrivals, exponential
    service times), M/M/s models, cost--service tradeoff analysis.
-   **Outcome**: Identified staffing strategies balancing cost and
    service quality; 5 agents reduced average wait times below 5
    minutes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4️⃣ Statistical Clinical Trial

-   **Domain**: Healthcare
-   **Goal**: Assess treatment effectiveness using survival analysis on
    patient data.
-   **Techniques**: Kaplan--Meier estimator, Log-Rank test, Cox
    Proportional Hazards model, competing risk models.
-   **Outcome**: No significant treatment difference found, but **cell
    type and Karnofsky score** emerged as significant predictors of
    survival.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5️⃣ Manufacturing Quality Control (Control Charts)

-   **Domain**: Manufacturing
-   **Goal**: Monitor and detect quality shifts in a production line
    using statistical process control.
-   **Techniques**: P-charts, CUSUM, EWMA, Cp index for process
    capability.
-   **Outcome**: Detected a defect rate shift (5% → 8%), signaling poor
    quality control (Cp = 0.4476).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6️⃣ IPL Data Analysis (2008--2023)

-   **Domain**: Sports Analytics
-   **Goal**: Explore performance trends in IPL cricket between league
    and playoff matches.
-   **Techniques**: Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann--Whitney U test, violin
    plots, regression analysis.
-   **Outcome**: Found **no significant differences** between league and
    playoff matches; consistent team-wise performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7️⃣ Election Statistics (1977--2014)

-   **Domain**: Political Analytics
-   **Goal**: Analyze Indian election data to study voter turnout,
    gender representation, and party performance.
-   **Techniques**: ANOVA, correlation analysis, Gini coefficient, pie &
    line charts.
-   **Outcome**: Male-dominated candidate pool, but female candidates
    had higher success rates; electoral competition increased over
    decades.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

-   **Programming**: Python 3.8+, Jupyter Notebook
-   **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy,
    statsmodels, lifelines, yfinance
-   **Version Control**: Git & GitHub for collaboration and tracking\
-   **Documentation**: Markdown integrated with notebooks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Results & Insights

-   **VaR (Finance)**: Estimated portfolio risk (2.89--3.07%) with
    diversification benefits.
-   **A/B Testing (Marketing)**: Variant B outperformed with significant
    conversion uplift.
-   **Call Center (Operations)**: Simulation showed staffing directly
    impacts service quality.
-   **Clinical Trial (Healthcare)**: Identified critical predictors of
    patient survival.
-   **Quality Control (Manufacturing)**: Detected process shifts
    requiring intervention.
-   **IPL (Sports Analytics)**: Historical consistency in team scoring
    patterns.
-   **Elections (Political Science)**: Gender disparities observed;
    competition intensified over time.
